PYTHON NLTK TALK

Goal is to describe NLTK, starting for python beginners and then moving to some more difficult stuff before we break out

We want to write programs that deal with human language (esp. words), e.g.:
Analyze and make sense of text for our own nefarious purposes.
We can:
    split text into words
    turn those words into lemmas
    tag words with parts of speech
    do interesting things with words
    
We can use these steps to build interesting programs:
    do sentiment analysis of things (tweets, articles)
    extract the most important words from texts (to find out what they're about)
    feed our results into an engine (a chatbot, etc)
    translate words

What do we need NLTK for? Python has string operations!
To minimize errors! Humans don't talk wrong...
-NLTK outperforms regexes on just about everything...
    -tokenization (splitting text into words requires more than just whitespace/apostrophes)
    -lemmatization (turning words into their "headword" or the dictionary key that they need)
    -POS tagging (finding out what part of speech a word is)
-NLTK provides a lot of tools for doing text-related operations
    -mach learning functions (Bayesian)
    -parsers for understanding sentences
    -lots of corpuses to play with!
-NLTK represents the best in computation linguistics: we should
    -use the best tools
    -don't reinvent the wheel

    
Let's look at 3 things you can do with NLTK:
    -extract information about the words in a text
        -what the words and sentences are
        -what PoS they are
        -what they mean (dictionary api)
    -extract information about the sentences in a text
        -their parse tree
        -a sentence summarizer
    -create your own word categorizer
        -use a corpus
        -train a classifier
